Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D3933,Warning,0.78,VPN/MFA reset request with moderate exfiltration score (0.468) and PowerShell execution. However, passing SPF and low spam score (0.012) suggest potentially legitimate but risky activity. Self-signed SSL warrants caution.
D3934,Malicious,0.92,Wire transfer request with extremely high AMSI score (0.701) and spam content (0.917). Failed SPF/DKIM/DMARC authentication trinity with high SMTP geo-risk (0.717) confirms business email compromise attempt.
D3935,Warning,0.75,Document download request with expired SSL certificate and moderate exfiltration behavior (0.556). Unscanned attachment present but passing authentication and low spam score suggest potentially risky content rather than confirmed malicious.
D3936,No Action,0.90,Clean email with no malicious indicators. All attachment scores are zero, no executable content. Failed SPF/DKIM appears to be configuration issue. Self-signed SSL but no concerning behavioral patterns.
D3937,Malicious,0.88,Sender marked as known malicious with sensitive data request. SMTP IP known malicious with URL shortener detected. Valid SSL but sender reputation overrides infrastructure legitimacy.
