Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D4183,No Action,0.85,Low risk indicators across most signals with sender domain reputation 0.14 (moderate), failed authentication (DMARC fail) but no malicious attachments or known threats detected. High risk role not targeted and no urgent request type
D4184,No Action,0.90,Very low sender domain reputation but all malicious indicators are zero. Passed SPF with valid TLS connection. Sensitive data request type but extremely low risk scores across all security signals indicate likely false positive
D4185,Warning,0.75,Moderate suspicious signals including sender domain reputation 0.0001, max metadata suspicious score 0.147, and behavioral sandbox score 0.13. Meeting request type with failed DMARC but executable attachment not present
D4186,Warning,0.80,Similar pattern to D4185 with moderate behavioral scores, VBScript detected, and failed authentication. Meeting request targeting but low overall malicious indicators suggest cautionary approach needed
D4187,No Action,0.88,Clean profile with very low malicious indicators, passed SPF, and no suspicious request types. SSL mismatch noted but other security signals are minimal
D4188,Malicious,0.92,Multiple high-risk indicators: IOC count 4, high exfiltration behavior score 0.368, legal threat request type, and high URL reputation concerns. Strong malicious pattern detected
D4189,Malicious,0.95,Critical threat with executable attachment, ActiveX objects detected, very high exfiltration behavior score 0.57, and link click request type. Multiple malicious components present
D4190,No Action,0.80,Moderate sender domain reputation but all attachment-based threats are zero. Bank detail update request but low confidence malicious indicators throughout
D4191,Malicious,0.88,Return path mismatch, macro-enabled document, behavioral sandbox detection, and VPN/MFA reset request type. Multiple process execution indicators suggest targeted attack
D4192,Malicious,0.93,Sender spoofing detected with high behavioral scores, wire transfer request type, and multiple suspicious SSL indicators. Clear financial fraud attempt
D4193,Malicious,0.85,High sender domain reputation risk 0.347 with document download request type and elevated behavioral scores. URL count of 6 suggests potential phishing campaign
D4194,No Action,0.82,Failed authentication but minimal malicious indicators and no active request types. Low confidence threat signals across most categories
D4195,No Action,0.75,Moderate sender reputation issues with sensitive data request type but no malicious attachments or behavioral indicators detected
D4196,Warning,0.70,High sandbox execution time 48.9 seconds with meeting request type suggests possible time-delayed payload. Final URL known malicious is concerning
D4197,Warning,0.78,VBScript detection with embedded files and failed authentication. Low confidence but multiple suspicious indicators warrant monitoring
D4198,No Action,0.85,High sender domain reputation 0.414 but expired SSL and minimal other risk indicators. URL count of 6 but no request type suggests bulk marketing
D4199,Malicious,0.90,High behavioral scores, temp email likelihood 0.42, legal threat request type with unsubscribe present. Classic phishing pattern with urgency tactics
D4200,Malicious,0.85,High exfiltration behavior score 0.785 with link click request type. Multiple security validation failures indicate active threat

D4202,Warning,0.72,ActiveX objects with VPN/MFA reset request type. PowerShell execution detected but low overall malicious scores suggest monitoring needed
D4203,Malicious,0.88,High sender domain reputation risk 0.52 with temp email likelihood 0.74, wire transfer request, and embedded files. Clear BEC attempt
D4204,Malicious,0.92,Multiple concerning indicators with document download request, high behavioral scores, and QR code present. Sophisticated attack vector
D4205,No Action,0.78,High sender domain reputation but no specific request type and minimal active threat indicators. Marketing content likely
D4206,No Action,0.80,Sensitive data request with failed authentication but very low malicious scores across all categories indicate false positive
D4207,Malicious,0.85,IOC count of 8 with temp email likelihood 0.23, meeting request type, and multiple security failures. Coordinated attack pattern
D4208,Warning,0.75,High sender domain reputation 0.87 with image-only email format. Bulk message indicator suggests potential gray-mail requiring monitoring
D4209,No Action,0.88,Reply path known malicious flagged but all other indicators minimal. Clean authentication and no request types suggest automated flagging
D4210,Malicious,0.94,Multiple high-risk indicators: IOC count 4, YARA match 1, high urgency keywords, legal threat type, and URL shortener. Sophisticated attack
D4211,Warning,0.78,High temp email likelihood 0.14 with link click request but neutral DKIM status and minimal other threats suggest cautious approach
D4212,No Action,0.82,High temp email likelihood 0.93 but bank detail update with minimal malicious indicators and valid SSL suggest legitimate business communication
D4213,Malicious,0.87,High behavioral scores with VPN/MFA reset request type. DMARC enforcement present but multiple suspicious indicators override
D4214,Warning,0.80,High metadata suspicious score 0.44 with wire transfer request and is_high_risk_role_targeted flag. Requires investigation
D4215,Warning,0.75,DMARC enforced but document download request with high URL reputation concerns and failed DMARC result warrant monitoring
D4216,No Action,0.85,Minimal active threat indicators despite failed authentication. High return path reputation but no request types suggest legitimate traffic
