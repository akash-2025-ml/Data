Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D3433,Malicious,0.88,Email shows critical threats with very high exfiltration score (0.98) and high-risk processes (acrobat/cmd/curl/rundll32). AMSI score moderate (0.53) and embedded file present. Process combination with exfiltration indicates malware.
D3434,Warning,0.80,Email contains moderate risk indicators including executable processes (winword/powershell/regsvr32) and DKIM failure. Moderate behavioral sandbox score (0.18) and AMSI score (0.68) suggest potentially risky but not confirmed malicious content.
D3435,No Action,0.95,Email appears legitimate with no malicious indicators detected. All attachment scans clean sender not known malicious legal threat category likely legitimate business communication. SPF softfail is minor concern but overall safe.
D3436,No Action,0.85,Email shows minimal risk despite unscannable attachment. Very low threat scores across all metrics sender reputation good and no malicious behaviors detected. Unscannable file raises caution but insufficient evidence for action.
D3437,No Action,0.90,Clean email with no malicious indicators. No attachments no suspicious behaviors and good sender reputation. DKIM/DMARC failures are authentication issues but no malicious content detected.
D3438,No Action,0.88,Invoice verification email appears legitimate. No malicious files or behaviors detected good sender reputation scores. URL present but reputation clean. Standard business communication.
D3439,Malicious,0.92,High risk email with multiple red flags: high metadata suspicious score (0.88) network call on open behavior detected high exfiltration score (0.57) and suspicious processes. DKIM failure and self-signed SSL certificate indicate phishing attempt.
D3440,Warning,0.73,Email has very high sender domain reputation score (0.93) self-signed SSL certificate and high URL reputation (0.63). While no malicious files detected the reputation indicators and self-signed cert require caution.
D3441,No Action,0.90,Clean email with minimal risk indicators. Three URLs detected but all have good reputation no malicious files and standard TLS encryption. Safe business communication.
D3442,Warning,0.70,Meeting request with some concerning indicators: executable processes detected (winword) moderate exfiltration behavior (0.20) and certificate mismatch. While not definitively malicious requires caution due to social engineering potential.
D3443,Spam,0.85,Sensitive data request with high sender temp email likelihood (0.81) and poor return path reputation. DKIM failure and moderate risk indicators suggest spam/phishing attempt rather than legitimate request.
D3444,Malicious,0.88,Email shows multiple malicious indicators: exploit pattern detected high exfiltration score (0.54) suspicious processes (excel/cmd/powershell) and failed authentication. Pattern consistent with malware delivery attempt.
D3445,No Action,0.81,Email has sender spoofing flag but actually shows minimal threats. Very low metadata score no malicious files four URLs with good reputation. Spoofing flag appears to be false positive given overall clean profile.
D3446,No Action,0.92,Link click request appears legitimate with very low threat scores across all metrics. No malicious indicators authentication passes and safe domain reputation.
D3447,Malicious,0.90,High risk email with significant threats: high metadata suspicious score (0.25) high behavioral sandbox score (0.55) and exfiltration behavior (0.28). Failed DKIM and QR code detected indicate sophisticated phishing.
D3448,Malicious,0.85,Invoice payment request with high behavioral sandbox score (0.62) moderate exfiltration behavior (0.39) and suspicious processes. Four URLs detected pattern indicates BEC/invoice fraud attempt.
D3449,No Action,0.79,Email with domain known malicious flag but extremely low threat scores throughout. Metadata score minimal (0.0007) no malicious behaviors SMTP geo moderate (0.28). Domain flag likely false positive given clean profile.
D3450,No Action,0.88,Meeting request appears legitimate despite some URL concerns. Very low threat scores no malicious files and passing authentication. URLs present but clean reputation.
D3451,Malicious,0.93,Invoice verification with multiple severe indicators: high metadata score (0.48) network call on open detected moderate exfiltration (0.15) exploit pattern detected and suspicious processes. Clear malware delivery attempt.
D3452,Spam,0.82,Sender known malicious with high SMTP IP geo risk (0.53). While no malicious files detected the known bad sender and poor reputation indicate spam campaign.
D3453,Malicious,0.95,Gift card request scam with severe indicators: high temp email likelihood (0.70) very high exfiltration score (0.79) YARA rule matches and high AMSI score (0.79). Classic BEC gift card scam.
D3454,Spam,0.78,Email with moderate sender reputation issues expired SSL certificate and URL redirect detected. Pattern suggests spam campaign rather than targeted attack.
D3455,Malicious,0.91,Credential request with critical red flags: high temp email likelihood (0.78) very high exfiltration score (0.87) exploit pattern detected and self-signed certificate. Credential harvesting attempt.
D3456,Malicious,0.89,Email with significant threats: high metadata score (0.38) moderate behavioral score (0.11) exploit pattern detected and failed authentication. Two embedded files suggest multi-stage attack.
D3457,No Action,0.85,Meeting request appears mostly legitimate despite expired SSL certificate. Very low threat scores no malicious files detected and four URLs all clean. Certificate issue likely misconfiguration.
D3458,Malicious,0.87,Email with concerning indicators: DMARC enforced failure malicious attachment detected YARA rule matches and high exfiltration score (0.49). Compromised sender attempting malware delivery.
D3459,Spam,0.80,High temp email likelihood (0.75) with poor sender reputation and four URLs detected. DMARC temperror and overall pattern suggest spam campaign rather than targeted attack.
D3460,Spam,0.83,Link click request with very high temp email likelihood (0.84) and poor reputation scores. Three URLs detected pattern indicates spam/phishing campaign.
D3461,Malicious,0.86,Document download request with sender spoofing detected and high exfiltration score (0.95). DMARC permerror and overall pattern indicate targeted phishing for document theft.
D3462,Malicious,0.88,Email with multiple serious indicators: return path known malicious SMTP IP known malicious high exfiltration score (0.64) URL redirect detected. Coordinated attack from compromised infrastructure.
D3463,No Action,0.82,Email with moderate temp email likelihood (0.22) but very low threat scores throughout. No malicious files no suspicious behaviors two URLs clean. Safe communication despite minor indicators.
