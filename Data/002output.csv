Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D3483,No Action,0.78,Email shows relatively low risk despite exfiltration score (0.57). Metadata score low (0.068) minimal behavioral score (0.0004) and AMSI score low (0.095). YARA match but overall threat profile minimal.
D3484,No Action,0.85,Email appears legitimate despite high SMTP IP geo risk (0.97). No malicious indicators detected no suspicious behaviors and very low threat scores. DMARC permerror is configuration issue not malicious intent.
D3485,No Action,0.88,Clean email with moderate temp email likelihood (0.50) but all other indicators show minimal risk. Two URLs present but clean. Authentication passes except DMARC temperror. Safe communication.
D3486,No Action,0.82,Gift card request but with very low threat scores across all metrics. No malicious files or behaviors detected. Expired SSL certificate concerning but insufficient evidence of actual threat.
D3487,No Action,0.84,Bank detail update request with moderate sender reputation but minimal actual threats. No malicious content detected authentication failures but pattern suggests legitimate business email.
D3488,No Action,0.80,Email with moderate temp email likelihood (0.38) but otherwise clean indicators. Four URLs all with good reputation. No malicious behaviors detected appears safe.
D3489,Malicious,0.88,Significant threats detected: high exfiltration score (0.65) packer detected moderate metadata score (0.14) bulk message indicator. Failed authentication and pattern indicates obfuscated malware delivery.

D3501,No Action,0.83,Legal threat email with moderate sender reputation but low actual risk scores. Expired SSL certificate and DMARC temperror but no malicious content detected. Likely legitimate legal communication.
D3502,Spam,0.77,Document download request with moderate risks: high spam content score (0.58) expired SSL certificate DKIM failure. Pattern suggests spam campaign rather than targeted attack.
D3503,Malicious,0.87,Gift card request scam: high metadata score (0.26) high exfiltration score (0.77) executable attachment marketing keywords detected. Classic BEC gift card fraud attempt.
